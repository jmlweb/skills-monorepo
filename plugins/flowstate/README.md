## ✨ What is Flowstate?

Flowstate adds a structured, file-based backlog to any project. Everything lives in a `.backlog/` directory that you can read, edit, and commit alongside your code. Claude understands the full system and manages the lifecycle end to end: **triage → plan → implement → learn**.

```
.backlog/
├── tasks/          # pending → active → complete
├── ideas/          # pending → approved/discarded
├── reports/        # pending → triaged/discarded
└── learnings/      # searchable knowledge base
```

---

## 🚀 Quick start

### 1. Install

```bash
# From the marketplace (recommended)
claude plugin marketplace add jmlweb/claude-plugins
claude plugin install flowstate@jmlweb
```

### 2. Initialize your backlog

```
/flowstate:setup
```

### 3. Start working

```
/flowstate:add-task                   # add your first task
/flowstate:start-task TSK-001         # start working on it
# ... do the work ...
/flowstate:complete-task TSK-001      # mark it done
/flowstate:overview                   # see the big picture
```

That's it. You're managing a backlog. 🎉

## 📦 Installation

<details>
<summary><strong>🏪 Marketplace (recommended)</strong></summary>

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add jmlweb/claude-plugins
claude plugin install flowstate@jmlweb
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>👥 Team setup</strong></summary>

Add the marketplace to your project's `.claude/settings.json` so everyone has access:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": ["jmlweb/claude-plugins"]
}
```

Then each team member runs:

```bash
claude plugin install flowstate@jmlweb
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔧 Manual installation</strong></summary>

No build step needed — `dist/` ships pre-built.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmlweb/flowstate-skill.git ~/.claude/plugins/flowstate
```

Or as a submodule:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/jmlweb/flowstate-skill.git .claude/plugins/flowstate
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🧪 Local development</strong></summary>

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./path/to/flowstate-skill
```

Use `/reload-plugins` after making changes.

## 📋 Commands

### Core

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/flowstate:setup` | Create the `.backlog/` directory structure. Safe to re-run |
| `/flowstate:overview` | Backlog overview with stats, active work, and health warnings |

### 📝 Tasks

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/flowstate:add-task` | Interactively add a task (title, description, acceptance criteria, priority, tags) |
| `/flowstate:start-task` | Move a task from pending to active. Loads relevant learnings and context |
| `/flowstate:complete-task` | Mark a task done. Verifies acceptance criteria and extracts learnings |
| `/flowstate:block-task` | Block a task with a documented reason. Suggests alternatives |
| `/flowstate:check-task` | Verify a task's status matches actual implementation in the codebase |
| `/flowstate:next-task` | Smart recommendation based on priority, dependencies, and recent work |
| `/flowstate:parallel` | Run multiple independent tasks simultaneously in isolated git worktrees |

### 🗺️ Ideas

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/flowstate:idea` | Generate an implementation plan — explores code, identifies risks, saves for review |
| `/flowstate:review-idea` | Approve (converts to task), discard, or revise a pending plan |

### 🐛 Reports

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/flowstate:report` | File a structured bug report, finding, or security issue |
| `/flowstate:triage-report` | Convert a pending report to a task, discard it, or request more info |

### 💡 Learnings

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/flowstate:add-learning` | Document an insight or lesson discovered during development |
| `/flowstate:learnings` | Browse and search the learnings index |
| `/flowstate:condense-learnings` | Deduplicate, archive stale entries, and normalize tags |

## 🧠 Smart features

### 🔮 Context-aware skills

Skills that involve starting or planning work automatically load relevant context before acting:

- **Learnings** — retrieved via deterministic CLI search (scored by tag match + keyword relevance)
- **Active tasks** — to spot conflicts and overlaps
- **Pending reports** — known bugs in scope

If nothing relevant is found, the skill proceeds silently. The goal is **zero-effort awareness** — the backlog informs the work automatically.

> Affected skills: `start-task`, `next-task`, `idea`, `parallel`

### 🤖 Proactive behavior

Claude suggests Flowstate commands when relevant — you don't always need to invoke them manually:

| Situation | Claude suggests |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 🐛 Discovers a bug while working | `/flowstate:report` |
| 💡 Learns something non-obvious | `/flowstate:add-learning` |
| 🏗️ Starting a complex feature | `/flowstate:idea` |
| ✅ Finishes work on a task | `/flowstate:complete-task` |
| 📖 Before starting work | Reads learnings to avoid past mistakes |

### ⚡ Parallel execution

Run independent tasks simultaneously in isolated git worktrees:

```
/flowstate:parallel TSK-004,TSK-005,TSK-006
```

Each subagent works in isolation. Overlap detection prevents conflicts. Results are collected when all tasks finish.

The plugin follows a clear separation of concerns:

- **Skills** (markdown) handle orchestration — they tell Claude *what* to do
- **CLI** (TypeScript) handles mutations — it *does* the file operations deterministically
- **Hooks** handle proactive triggers — they fire on events like test failures

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U([You]) -- "/flowstate:..." --> S[Skill]
    S -- reads/analyzes --> B[(.backlog/)]
    S -- mutations --> CLI[CLI tool]
    CLI -- creates/moves/updates --> B
    C([Claude]) -. "proactive suggestions" .-> S

### Backlog structure

│   ├── active/               # TSK-003-fix-pagination.md

```

Every file uses YAML frontmatter for metadata and markdown for content:

```markdown
---
id: TSK-001
title: Add user authentication
status: pending
priority: P2
tags: [backend, auth]
created: 2026-04-05
depends-on: []
---

# Add user authentication

## Description
Implement JWT-based auth for the API.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Login endpoint returns a valid JWT
- [ ] Protected routes reject unauthenticated requests
- [ ] Token refresh works within the expiry window
```

### ID format

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Task | `TSK-XXX` | `TSK-001` |
| Idea | `PLN-XXX` | `PLN-003` |
| Report | `RPT-XXX` | `RPT-007` |
| Learning | `LRN-XXX` | `LRN-002` |

### Priority levels

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **P1** 🔴 | Critical — blocking other work |
| **P2** 🟠 | High — do next |
| **P3** 🟡 | Normal backlog |
| **P4** 🟢 | Nice to have |

## Skills

### ✍️ `/commit` — Smart commits

Analyzes staged changes, infers the commit type and scope, and generates a [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) message for your approval.

```bash
/commit                           # interactive — analyzes and suggests
/commit "feat: add dark mode"     # direct message
/commit "fix(auth): token expiry" # with explicit scope
```

**What it does:**
- 🔍 Detects commit type from the diff (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `docs`, `chore`…)
- 🌿 Infers scope from directory structure or branch name
- 🔐 Scans staged files for secrets before committing (`.env`, API keys, SSH keys…)
- ⚠️ Warns before committing to `main`/`master`
- 🪝 Surfaces hook failures and never skips them without your permission

### 📦 `/changeset` — Monorepo changesets

For [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)-managed monorepos. Detects which packages changed, picks the right semver bump, generates the changeset file, and commits everything.

```bash
/changeset                    # interactive
/changeset "feat: new export" # direct message
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Validates the `.changeset/` directory exists
- 📂 Identifies modified packages from staged files
- 🏷️ Classifies the bump type (`major` / `minor` / `patch`) from the nature of the changes
- 🎲 Generates a randomized changeset filename (`calm-lions-dance.md`)
- 🚫 Never runs `changeset version` locally — leaves that to CI

### 🔎 `/review-pr` — PR review with parallel agents

Fetches the PR diff and launches specialized agents in parallel to produce a structured review with risk assessment.

```bash
/review-pr        # detects PR from current branch
/review-pr 123    # by PR number
/review-pr <url>  # by full GitHub URL
```

**What it does:**
- 🧑‍💻 Always runs a **code-reviewer** for quality and conventions
- 🔒 Conditionally adds a **security-reviewer** (auth, payments, env vars, DB queries)
- 🧪 Conditionally adds a **qa-engineer** (critical user flows, new API endpoints)
- ✅ Checks CI status via `gh pr checks`
- 📋 Produces a full report with risk matrix and merge recommendation

> **Requires:** [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`)

### 📝 `/check-docs` — Documentation audit

Audits markdown files for freshness, formatting issues, and consistency. Fixes what it can automatically; asks before touching content.

```bash
/check-docs                  # full project audit
/check-docs README.md        # single file
/check-docs packages/        # specific directory
/check-docs agents           # focus on AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md only
/check-docs --dry-run        # preview without writing
```

**What it does:**
- 🔄 Validates agent instructions (`AGENTS.md`, `.claude/`) for freshness against `package.json`
- 🧹 Checks formatting: code block languages, heading structure, duplicate headings, tables
- 🤖 **Auto-fixes** minor issues (trailing whitespace, missing code fence language, obvious version mismatches)
- 🙋 **Asks before** changing content, removing docs, or adding sections
- 📊 **Reports only** broken external links and major restructuring needs
- 🗂️ Monorepo-aware: checks each package independently
